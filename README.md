## Breast Cancer Classifier

This project is a machine learning model built with PyTorch that classifies breast cancer images. 

The model was trained on the [BreakHis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambarish/breakhis), which has two classifications: malignant or benign.

To use, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
